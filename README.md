# The UNIX Philosophy
Presentation: The UNIX Philosophy - Why it still matters for solid system, software, solution design

We review this seminal 1995 book’s description of arguably the nine most important I.T. design principles in the last half-century. We’ll briefly revisit a bit of computing history and each of the principles that have been instrumental to *nix’s tremendous success. We’ll discuss how they apply to the latest paradigms and languages and see how you can incorporate The UNIX Philosophy into your daily work.

This presentation deck is genuinely for everyone in IT, especially software developers, architects, sysadmins and technical team managers.
